# Kenya Crops Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of agricultural production in Kenya. It visualizes crop performance, revenue, profit, farmer distribution, and land usage across different counties and crop types.

---

## Project Goals

- Provide a data-driven overview of crop performance across Kenya.
- Help stakeholders (farmers, researchers, NGOs, and policymakers) identify high-revenue crops and optimize farming strategies.
- Encourage transparency and collaboration in agricultural planning using real-world data visualization.

---

##The data includes:
- Crop type
- County
- Farmer name
- Yield
- Revenue and production cost
- Land area

---

## Key Insights

- **Rice** is the most profitable crop across the dataset.
- **Nyeri County** leads in total revenue contribution (~15%).
- Production cost remains stable throughout the year, while revenue fluctuates ‚Äî especially peaking in January.
- Farmers are fairly distributed across major crops like Potatoes, Coffee, and Tea.
- The dashboard allows filtering by county, crop type, farmer, and month.
